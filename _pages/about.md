I am a Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, USA. I have been working with Dr. [Raktim Bhattacharya](https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/profiles/rbhattacharya.html){:target="_blank"} in [Intelligent Systems Research Laboratory](http://isrlab.github.io/){:target="_blank"} at Texas A&M since August, 2017. I received my B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in Aerospace Engineering from [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, India in 2016. I worked as a Senior Engineer in Honeywell Aerospace, Bangalore, India before joining the Ph.D. program.

My research interests are: uncertainty quantification, surrogate modeling, data-driven methods, numerical methods, multi-disciplinary optimization.
